## Introduction

fireSignal is a hardware device developed to enable rapid-fire shooting practice across various disciplines. Before each round of shots, a timer is set to indicate to the shooter when to begin firing and when to stop.
- It allows setting intervals from 1 second up to 99 minutes.
- It features two indicators: one visual and one audible.
- It is very convenient for use at shooting ranges that do not have an automated target system, for example when practicing FBI-style shooting.
- Additionally, there is no need to have an assistant instructor present.

Hardware:
- Arduino Nano V3 CH340 (x2)
